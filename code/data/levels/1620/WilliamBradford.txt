Hello. My Name is William   Bradford.
Hello. I am lost. Do you    know where I am?
You are in Holland.
By the way, what is going on here?
We are the Purtians and we  are journeying to the New   World.
Why would you want to leave Holland? It seems really    nice.
We want religious freedom.
Could I help at all?
Sure! Go talk to Myles      Standish. He probaly has a  job for you.
Thanks!
